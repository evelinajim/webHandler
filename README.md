# WebServer
Here I will be testing the WebServer for different files as well as a persistent TCP connection.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 32-bit
* Pycharm 3.6 32-bit
* import: `threading, mimetypes, socket, WebHandler` 
* set a local host port you will use. In this example we're using port 81

## Features
* Persistent TCP Connection
* Two image files
* A navigation bar
* Multiple HTML files found in the navigation bar
* An aesthetically pleasing search bar

## Details
* Screen Resolution: 1366 x 768
* Processor: Intel Core i5 @ 2.90 Ghz
* System type: 64-bit operating system. x64-based processor
* Windows 10 Pro

## Run WebHandler on
* http://localhost:81/

## Youtube
* The video of me testing the program: https://youtu.be/cFHWWpUcIKo 
* Thing I hadn't mentioned in the video. The fav icon is connected to the small icon at the top of the browser!
* You can't see it in my project because of the persistent connection presenting the loading page.
* When I said you don't import I meant you don't add it to your library through the project interpreter
